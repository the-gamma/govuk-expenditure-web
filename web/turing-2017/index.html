      <h1>The Alan Turing Institute<br/><em>Year 2017 in numbers</em></h1>
      <p>
        The Alan Turing Institute is the United Kingdom national institute for data sciences, 
        founded in 2015. It is named after Alan Turing, the British mathematician and computing pioneer.
        Since getting started in 2015, the institute hired its first Research Fellows, published 
        over <span id="stats-youtube-count"></span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcr5vuAH5TPlYox-QLj4ySw">recorded talks</a>,
        over <span id="stats-pubs-count"></span> <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/publications/">academic publications</a> and started
        new <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/category/research/projects/">research projects</a>
        that advance the fields of data science, machine learning and many more.</p>
      <p>Here, we present information about the Alan Turing Institute in a fun interactive way.
        We are using tools developed as part of <a href="https://thegamma.net/">The 
        Gamma</a> project, which make it possible to present data transparently. Behind 
        every number and every chart on this page, there is source code that links the chart to the primary data 
        source and lets you check the data and explore further. For example, if you want to verify that
        the Institute hosted <span id="stats-event-count"></span> events, click on the number to 
        see the raw data from which it is calculated!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>The interactive visualizations on this page are inspired by
        <a href="https://nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/15/us/politics/you-draw-obama-legacy.html">the
        You Draw It series by New York Times</a> and let you make your own guess about the data
        before showing the actual numbers. To make this more fun, we calculate a score that tells
        you how good your guesses are! When you are done, share the results with us at 
        <a href="https://twitter.com/turinginst">@turinginst</a>. How many of the facts about the

      <h3><span>When are videos published</span></h3>
      <p>Let's now have a more detailed look at the YouTube video views. The bubble chart

        it was published. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see huge spike in activity around October 2016 when regular talk series started
        and then a break around Christmas 2016. Since then, activity has been more regular.
      </p>
      <p>Now the game part! The line chart below shows total video views per day. This jumps
        up and down, so the line chart shows average values over two weeks. Can you guess

        The Alan Turing Institute hosted over <span id="events-count"></span> events. Those
        include <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/past-events/">Turing Lectures</a>, which feature
        lectures by prominent researchers visiting the institute, <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/past-events/">Fellow
        Short Talks</a> where Turing researchers introduce their work, smaller informal workshops 
        where new collaborations are initiated and also a range of events for students.
        In total, number of visits for all events hosted at the institute was over <span id="events-people"></span>.
        Note that we do not track individual visitors, so if you attended two events, you will be counted twice.            
      </p>
      <p>The following chart gives an overview of the events. The institute started hosting early 
        scoping workshops between December 2015 and continued throughout 2016. A lot more activity
        started once the institute officially opened in October 2016.</p>

      <p>As you can see in the following chart, the two most common kinds of events hosted at the
        institute are workshops and lectures. Since the institute was established, it hosted
        <span id="events-count-lecture"></span> lectures and 
        <span id="events-count-workshop"></span> workshops. The number of short talks and 
        larger conferences was smaller.

      <p>
        The total number of visitors to any of the events was <span id="events-people2"></span>,

      <p>This report is generated live using the original dataset that contains all information
        used in the report in a form that is not aggregated in any way. This means that you can
        easily explore the data further on your own. In this section, you can access some of the
        original data. For example, below is a listing of people 
        <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/">based on the insititute web site</a>.
        To make filtering simpler, everyone from the Leadership team is listed as being
        affiliated with The Alan Turing Institute rather than their other institutions.</p>
