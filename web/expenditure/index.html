        <p>
        Our goal is to promote the ability to examine data, to learn to question the legitimacy of its source, and appreciate the context in which numbers are presented. We have chosen the UK Government public expenditure data for demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>Public expenditure is <a href="http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=public-spending">defined by the Financial Times</a>
          as <i>money spent by the Government on public services and other state-controlled operations, projects and investments.</i>
        If public expenditure data is easily accessible, we will understand how our money is spent, and question if it was used wisely. In order for the Government to ensure there is good value for money for the taxpayer, there should be maximal transparency of spending purposes.
        Citizens and organizations with good quality, well presented public expenditure information can ensure that services receiving public money are held fully to account.
        To begin with, we should be able to rapidly see what is available and then visualize what interests us. When we are able to place sections of public spending in context, we gain an understanding of the entire picture.
        </p>
        <p>The UK data in this demo has been sourced from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/public-expenditure-statistical-analyses-2016">Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses (PESA) report</a>.

        <p>As we saw in the previous section, the expenditure in each
          service of the government consists of several sub-services.
          To better understand the government expenditure, we look at
          some of the services in detail. First, a large portion
          of government expenditure is spent on "social protection", but
          how is the money distributed between different sub-services?
          Second, how much of the overall "education" expenditure is spent on
          primary, secondary and tertiary education?</p>

        <p>This report is created using <a href="https://thegamma.net/">The Gamma</a>,
          which makes data visualizations more transparent and so it allows you
          to easily modify the visualizations and explore other services. To get
          started, just click "open source code" and change the service you want to see!

        <p>One of the interesting trends in the government expenditure has been the
          growing investment into a service called "economic affairs". According to
          <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Government_expenditure_on_economic_affairs">Eurostat statistical analysis</a>,
          this includes capital injections into banks (for example in Greece).
          Expenditure on agriculture and fisheries falls within the EU competency and hence
          is low for member states. This part of government expenditure has been rising
          since 2012, but we can get better insight if we look at the individual
          sub-services.
