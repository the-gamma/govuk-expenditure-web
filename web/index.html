        <h1>The Gamma<br/><em>Democratizing data science</em></h1>
        <p>The rise of Big Data and Open Government Data initiatives means that there is an increasing
          amount of raw data available. At the same time, "post-truth" has been chosen as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37995600">the word of
          2016</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/19/crisis-of-statistics-big-data-democracy">public increasingly distrusts statistics</a>.
          In other words, data science has more capabilities to help us understand the world than ever
          before, yet it is becoming less relevant in public discussion.</p>
        <p>This should perhaps not be a surprise as data science is often opaque, non-experts find results
            difficult to interpret and verify, and creating data-driven reports is limited to a small number
            of specialists. The goal of The Gamma project is to democratize data science. Our tools encourage
            everyone — including journalists and interested citizens — to understand how presented claims
            are justified, explore data on their own and make their own transparent factual claims.
            If the society is to benefit from the possibilities available through data science, it is essential
            to make data-driven storytelling widely accessible, open and engaging.</p>
        </p>
        <h3>Open data visualizations</h3>
        <p>As part of the work on The Gamma at the Alan Turing Institute, we created a number of
          visualizations that explore and actively engage with interesting data sets ranging from
          facts about the to UK government spending. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><a href="/expenditure">Accounting for democracy</a>.</strong> This project
            explores the UK Government expenditure obtained from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/public-expenditure-statistical-analyses-2016">
            Public Expenditre Statistical Analyses 2016 report</a>. You can explore different aspects
            of government spending and also make your own guess about a number of topics
            in a series of interactive visualizations.</li>

          <li><strong><a href="/markets">Expected and unexpected</a>.</strong> This project
            looks at trends in financial markets and how are they be affected by events such
            as Brexit or the Lehman Brothers collapse. Each visualization is fully transparent,
            so you can see where we get the data from and how. They also encourage you to think
            critically about the problem. Can you guess when the price starts going up?</li>

          <li><strong><a href="/turing-2017">Turing 2017 in numbers</a>.</strong>
            We look at information about the Alan Turing Institute in a fun interactive and transparent way.
            Behind every chart on this page, there is source code that links the chart to the primary data
            source and lets you explore the data further. The visualizations are inspired by
            <a href="https://nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/15/us/politics/you-draw-obama-legacy.html">the
            You Draw It series by New York Times</a> and let you make your own guess about the data
            before showing the actual numbers. How many of the facts about the Alan Turing Institute
            can you guess correctly?</li>

          <li><strong><a href="/playground">Interactive playground</a>.</strong>
            This is a minimal page where you can explore any of the datasets available
            in The Gamma or uploaded to <a href="https://gallery.thegamma.net/">The Gamma gallery</a>.
            For example, start by typing <code>olympics</code> to explore Olympic medal winners or
            <code>worldbank</code> to explore World Bank statistics. Data from the two other projects
            are available here too!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For more information about the project, see <a href="http://thegamma.net">The Gamma homepage</a>.
          If you are a developer, you will also find out how to use The Gamma JavaScript package in your
          own projects and how to provide your own data sources. You can find more information about
          some of the aspects in our ECOOP paper <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/pivot/">Data exploration through dot-driven development</a>
          and in our European Data Journalism Conference abstract <a href="https://github.com/the-gamma/thegamma-publications/blob/master/edcjc-2017/abstract.pdf">The Gamma: Programming tools for open data-driven storytelling</a>.
          We also have a <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research_projects/the-gamma/">project page at the Alan Turing Institute</a>.</p>
