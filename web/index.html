        <h1>The Gamma<br/><em>Democratizing data science</em></h1>
        <p>The rise of Big Data and Open Government Data initiatives means that there is an increasing 
          amount of raw data available. At the same time, "post-truth" has been chosen as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37995600">the word of 
          2016</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/19/crisis-of-statistics-big-data-democracy">public increasingly distrusts statistics</a>. 
          In other words, data science has more capabilities to help us understand the world than ever 
          before, yet it is becoming less relevant in public discussion.</p>
        <p>This should perhaps not be a surprise as data science is often opaque, non-experts find results 
            difficult to interpret and verify, and creating data-driven reports is limited to a small number 
            of specialists. The goal of The Gamma project is to democratize data science. Our tools encourage 
            everyone — including journalists and interested citizens — to understand how presented claims 
            are justified, explore data on their own and make their own transparent factual claims. 
            If the society is to benefit from the possibilities available through data science, it is essential 
            to make data-driven storytelling widely accessible, open and engaging.</p>
        </p>
        <h3>Open data visualizations</h3>
        <p>As part of the work on The Gamma at the Alan Turing Institute, we created a number of 
          visualizations that explore and actively engage with interesting data sets ranging from 
          facts about the to UK government spending. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><a href="/expenditure">Accounting for democracy</a>.</strong> This project 
            explores the UK Government expenditure obtained from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/public-expenditure-statistical-analyses-2016">
            Public Expenditre Statistical Analyses 2016 report</a>. You can explore different aspects
            of government spending and also make your own guess about a number of topics
            in a series of interactive visualizations.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="/turing-2017">Turing 2017 in numbers</a>.</strong> 
            We look at information about the Alan Turing Institute in a fun interactive and transparent way.
            Behind every chart on this page, there is source code that links the chart to the primary data
            source and lets you explore the data further. The visualizations are inspired by
            <a href="https://nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/15/us/politics/you-draw-obama-legacy.html">the
            You Draw It series by New York Times</a> and let you make your own guess about the data
            before showing the actual numbers. How many of the facts about the Alan Turing Institute
            can you guess correctly?</li>
          <li><strong><a href="/playground">Interactive playground</a>.</strong> 
            This is a minimal page where you can explore any of the datasets available
            in The Gamma or uploaded to <a href="https://gallery.thegamma.net/">The Gamma gallery</a>.
            For example, start by typing <code>olympics</code> to explore Olympic medal winners or
            <code>worldbank</code> to explore World Bank statistics. Data from the two other projects
            are available here too!</li>
